# Information-Button-Attribute
Allows for information that is relevant to the variable or a class to be hidden behind a button that is usable within the inspector of Unity. Clicking this button brings up a small popup window with the information that is desired.


Example:

[InformationButton("ButtonText","WindowTitle","Information that you wish to have displayed")]<br/>
[SerializedField]<br/>
private float example = 0f;<br/>
